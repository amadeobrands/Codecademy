# To Be or Not to Be

# First up, on line 14, our hapless programmer has decided to check whether prime_array has a 
# value by using the .nil? method, which returns true if a value is nil and false otherwise. 
# This isn't a bad idea, and he even has the one-line if statement right!

# However, there's a better wayâ€”we can use conditional assignment to set prime_array to [] 
# rather than bother with the .nil? check.

def my_method(optional_param)
  optional_param ||= 3
  puts optional_param
end

my_method(5)
# puts 5
my_method(nil)
# puts 3


# Instructions

# Refactor the code on line 14 to use conditional assignment to set prime_array to [] 
# instead of using an if statement.

# ?
# Hint

# Remember, the conditional assignment operator works like this:

variable ||= value

# You won't need the if statement once you include ||=!
